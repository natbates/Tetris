Tetris Game i made in pygame as a passion project! The rotation is a bit shabby, the collisions occasionaly register weird with the tick/frame rate and the lose function
isnt perfect! 

This was made in the same time frame as my Chess game so it explains why the code is weirdly structured and not well formatted! :(
